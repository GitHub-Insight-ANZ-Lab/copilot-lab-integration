4. **Verify Installation:**
    - Open a new file in Visual Studio Code.
    - Start typing a comment or a piece of code, and you should see suggestions from GitHub Copilot.
    - If you see suggestions, GitHub Copilot is successfully installed and ready to use.

5. **Basic Usage:**
    - Create a new JavaScript file (`example.js`).
    - Start typing a function definition, e.g. `function add(a, b) {`.
    - Observe how GitHub Copilot suggests the implementation of the function.
    - Accept the suggestion by pressing `Tab`.

        - Type "GitHub Copilot: Chat" and select it.
        - Use the chat interface to ask questions or request code snippets.
    - **Inline Chat:**
        - Highlight a piece of code.
